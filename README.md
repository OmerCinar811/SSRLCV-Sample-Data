# SSRLCV Sample Data

The sample data here is a part of a dataset that was used in Caleb Adams' Thesis, [High Performance Computation with Small Satellites and Small Satellite Swarms for 3D Reconstruction](http://piepieninja.github.io/research-papers/thesis.pdf). The datasets here are used to test the SSRLCV software library, the SSRLCV is maintained at [the SSRLCV gitlab page](https://gitlab.smallsat.uga.edu/payload_software/SSRLCV) and [mirrored on github](https://github.com/uga-ssrl/SSRLCV). Additional test data is generated with the aid of the utility scripts in the [SSRLCV-Utilities gitlab repo](https://gitlab.smallsat.uga.edu/payload_software/ssrlcv-utilities), mirrored on githuib as [SSRLCV-Util](https://github.com/uga-ssrl/SSRLCV-Util). If you use these test sets in future research, or the methods described below to generate more test data, please cite my thesis:
